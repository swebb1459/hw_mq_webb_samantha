[Using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

I used this site as a starting point to review media query syntax.

[Media Queries Demystified: Min-Width and Max-Width](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/emailology_media_queries_demystified_min-width_and_max-width)

This site helped explain the difference between min and max width. While this is shown in the other article, it helps to solidify the information in my brain by reading seeing it in another way.

[HTML color codes and names](http://www.computerhope.com/htmcolor.htm)

I used this site to look up colors and their HTML codes.
