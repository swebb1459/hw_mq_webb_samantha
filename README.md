[Using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

I used this site as a starting point to review media query syntax.

[Media Queries Demystified: Min-Width and Max-Width](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/emailology_media_queries_demystified_min-width_and_max-width)

This site helped explain the difference between min and max width. While this is shown in the other article, it helps to solidify the information in my brain by reading and seeing it in another way.

[HTML color codes and names](http://www.computerhope.com/htmcolor.htm)

I used this site to look up colors and their HTML codes.

## Comments

This homework was a nice review. It was gratifying to see the background colors change as the width of the window changed. I reviewed the difference between min and max so hopefully I applied them to the right branch. I probably repeated the difference out loud at least a dozen times to ingrain it in by memory while working on this assignment.
